    "projectDescription" : "Poets Kingdom is a solo passion project I started at the end of my bachelor's degree. I am a lover of poetry, and I love writing poetry myself. Poets Kingdom is an application I made to help me design, view and write poems in a manner I see fit. Furthermore, it is tailor-made for mobile use. I noticed a severe lack of applications that help create customised themes and customised text fonts, so I created Poets Kingdom. It can produce high-quality images and PDF documents. It is an ongoing project that is written in Kotlin. Poets Kingdom is an open-source that is available on my GitHub repository. To create thumbnails and ensure high-quality images and PDF files, I had to recreate the theme and text of a poem from scratch. I had to implement logic to ensure text respects width and height bounds. Creating this application has been extremely exciting and challenging.",
